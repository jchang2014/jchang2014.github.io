      According to the personal thinking style quiz, I'm apparently an abstract sequential thinker. This means that not only do I conceive and visualize ideas and concepts without needed to visually see them, but I also take a linear and logical train of thought when dealing with information. While I actually really agree with these descriptions, I don't think I quite perfectly fit the bill for this thinking style. My last job in research definitely involved a lot of repeating the same tasks day in and day out, something I had no trouble with. Also, I don't have trouble expressing my emotions, nor do I have trouble with sentimental thinking. However, I think I can use this assessment to my advantage when taking on challenges. Most of the time, the challenges seem daunting at first, but after applying a linear path of logic to them, they can easily be broken down and conquered.

      In Phase 0 up to this point, the biggest struggle for me has been Week 2. I didn't really have any prior experience with HTML or CSS, so building a website from scratch was a big challenge for me. I had a lot of fun planning and building the wireframe, but once it came to putting the actual structure together in code, I had a lot of trouble. When I went through the HTML, I had to make sure I divided the sections properly, and had the adequate tags applied. Once I got to the CSS part, that's when all hell broke loose. I couldn't get any of my sections to stay put where I wanted, and the dimensions were all off. I ended up spending a lot of time just plugging and chugging until I got things to about the way I wanted them. However, I know that working with HTML and CSS takes a lot of practice, and after doing some extra research and studying on them I definitely feel a lot better about it.

      One of the things I really enjoy about DBC is the focus on a growth mindset. I really had a hard time going through school because I felt like as students, we were always pressured to produce good grades and that was it. I noticed all those around me solely focused on preparing for an exam, rather than being encouraged to focus on expanding their knowledge. In DBC we are encouraged to learn the topics, and then do our own research and practice with the concepts we are more interested in. I feel that this is a much more productive path, one that leads us to be much more successful.
