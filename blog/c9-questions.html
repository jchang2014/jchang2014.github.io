                No matter what field you're in, there are always going to be things you don't know. After all, learning is an ongoing process. However, in the programming field especially, we find ourselves asking each other lots of questions about our code. For times when you need to ask questions, you need to make sure you ask them properly so that you can get good answers. Here's how you should go about doing so.

                First of all, you need to have a title that perfectly sums up your problem in one sentence. This will help people figure out what you're asking, and hopefully answer your question. If they don't understand your question, they can't give you an answer. Next, explain your problem as much as you can, and provide examples so that people can see exactly what you did to run into the problem. Finally, remember to be humble and polite! A simple please and thank you will help you go far!

                Personally, I haven't asked any questions to the group, but I have asked for help from some of my fellow cohort. I was having trouble with HTML and CSS, and couldn't get my website to work. At first I asked just a simple question about how I should make divs in html, but I realized this was a very vague and unhelpful question. I then explained that I was trying to separate my homepage into three divs and format them accordingly with a h3, an image, and a paragraph. This helped him help me figure out the root of the problem, and how to make it work like I envisioned in my sitemap. Not only was this a good way for me to learn more about HTML and CSS, it was a good way for me to practice asking questions!
