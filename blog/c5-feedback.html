      When we first got our phase-0 handbooks, and I read that we'd need to pair with others at least 3 times a week, I got really nervous. I'm a complete novice at coding, and I wasn't sure I'd really be able to keep up with the material, let alone keep up with others. I was terrified that I'd be pairing with someone and not be able to contribute. I've always hated the idea of being dead weight on a team, which is probably why I've spent most of my time working on things alone. But, after the first week, I already felt much better about pairing. Not only does pairing with others let us share our ideas, and really find new ways to tackle problems, but it also allows us to learn from one another's strengths, and find our own weaknesses. I find it particularly enjoyable when a parter and I are stuck on a challenge, and he or she suggests something I've never thought of. We give it a shot, and POOF it works! Although it can get frustrating when we end up going down a rabbit hole of trying to make some code work that really just won't, it's also a great relief that there's someone sitting on the other side of the computer toughing it out with me.

      Originally, I thought feedback was kind of a pointless task. I got flashbacks back to grade school when we'd go over each other's essays and write the same generic "good ideas, good job" feedback. However, when I got my first feedback it felt pretty great. Spending a week struggling with code, and figuring out how to solve these challenges can be pretty exhausting, but at the end of it all getting some positive feedback from our peers is wonderful validation. It's also very helpful to get the constructive criticism on how to better communicate, and how to improve my thinking process. Based on the feedback I've received so far, I know that I'm pretty effective at sharing ideas while going through the process, there are times I can just sink into a zone and push out code without discussing what I'm doing. This is a really bad habit to get into, because not only does my partner not know what I'm doing, but I'm also circumventing the driver/navigator relationship that should refine the coding process.

      On the other side of the coin, I feel like writing feedback is definitely something difficult for me to do. I always feel pretty positively of my partner after peer-pairing, after all we did just conquer a challenge together. I rarely have any specific or actionable things to say, so I'm not sure my feedback is ever really tha helpful to the other person. While it's easy for me to say something along the lines of "thanks for being so communicative", or "you had some really great ideas for us to try", it's not really intuititve for me to point out something the other person can work on. Maybe it's possible that I've been lucky enough to pair with perfect partners, but I just don't know that it's beneficial for me to just give them a textual pat on the back. Despite this, I feel like overall the pairing and feedback system is not only something that's critical to our learning process, but it also helps to make our weekly challenges more fun. In our remote stage, it's easy to feel like we're struggling through this alone. But with this system in place, I know we're working as a team.
