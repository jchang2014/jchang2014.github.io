                  One of the conflicts I've experienced that sticks out most in my mind is one I had with my best friend in college. We both were pretty avid gamers, and enjoyed playing most nights and weekends, as most guys in college do. Even though we spent a lot of time playing games, we usually had a pretty good handle on staying on top of our schoolwork. However, that all changed once he started getting addicted to an online game. It was released at the worst possible time, right at the beginning of finals week. He played a few games, and promised to study with the rest of us once he was done. Of course as most addictions go, he started coming up with more and more excuses why he couldn't stop, until he stopped coming up with excuses altogether. Eventually, it came to the point where he was missing classes, work, and failing out of school. That was when I decided to step in and confront him. We had a big fight about it, culminating with him unplugging his laptop, and throwing it across the room at me. I got so angry that I basically told him I was going to have nothing to do with him anymore and left.

                <p>
                  Later on, I thought about why I had given up on my friend so easily and gotten so angry with his actions. I thought to myself that I had been trying so hard to convince him to get back on track over the past year, but he just didn't care enough about himself to listen. My motivation to stop caring was that I was wasting my time trying to help someone who wouldn't help himself. However, after thinking hard about it, I realized this wasn't about me, this was a friend's struggle with addiction. His lashing out wasn't because he was mad at me, but because he was struggling to accept that he had a problem. A few days later, after we had both cooled off, we sat down and had a heart to heart talk. This time, instead of confronting him head on and telling him he had a serious problem, I discussed with him the consequences that were happening as a result of his gaming addiction. We talked about how it was affecting those around him: his girlfriend, his family, and his friends. Finally, I brought up how I felt after he threw his laptop at me, and it clicked with him that if he was driven to the point of violence, he must have had a serious problem.

                <p>
                  From this experience, I learned that how you approach someone with a problem really affects how it will be resolved. I butted heads with my best friend, and antagonized him about his problem. It was only natural that he would lash out at me, and not hear what I was saying. I also learned that when dealing with someone with addiction, I have to remember that it's not about me, but about the person struggling with the addiction. So going forward, I need to be more considerate with the way I approach a conflict, and I need to be less self-centered in how I think about the situation.
