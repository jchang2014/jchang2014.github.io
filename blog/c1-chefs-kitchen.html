                    After watching the video, I am definitely very hyped up for DBC. The main reason I chose to pursue DBC is that I knew it was going to be different than anything I'd ever experienced. I've never really thrived in a classroom setting, I've always been the type to learn better by doing, rather than listening or watching. It's because of this that I really wanted to go for a bootcamp, rather than go back to school. After reading up on DBC from the website, I was really excited to be doing pair work, getting into the material at an accelerated pace, and getting training for real world coding. But I was especially impressed by the engineering empathy seminars, because I felt like that really said something about the instructors and people that make DBC happen.

                    Which leads me to my next point: I am totally thrilled for this culture because of the people that run it. Before starting DBC, I read posts on the blog by students, alumni, and staff. Just from those posts alone, I could tell that the people at DBC absolutely people I want to learn from, interact with, and be friends with. To me, DBC isn't just a program to teach me how to code, but it's an immersive learning experience I want to get just that from: an experience. I've always felt that a job isn't just about what you're working on, but also the people you're working on it with. So, it's super important to learn from those around you, and build a good relationship with them.

                    To be honest, I am pretty nervous about this kind of learning environment. Though I said that I learn better by doing, I feel like this is a whole different ballpark. My background is in Biology and Biochemistry, and I have little to no previous knowledge or experience in programming. I am literally going to sink or swim, but while that frightens me, it's also incredibly thrilling. If DBC is going to be a kitchen, as cliche as it sounds, I just hope that I can stand the heat.
