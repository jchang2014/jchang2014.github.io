                  Without a doubt, one of the biggest contributors to this roaring tech boom we find ourselves engrossed in this generation is the gaming industry. Every few years, the latest hardware is released, and every few weeks the next blockbuster title is produced for those new platforms. In 2004, the US game industry alone was worth $10.3 billion. Today, that number has grown to an estimated $20.5 billion. More and more people these days are indentifying themselves as gamers, and as a result, there is an overwhelming amount of profit to be made from this industry. However, that profit comes at a price that those who make these products have to pay.

                  Despite this unprecedented growth in the video games industry, we are hearing of more and more stories of developer layoffs and studio shutdowns. So why the discrepancy? If you go to <a href="www.kotaku.com">kotaku.com</a> and search for "video game layoffs", you'll see 5 different posts with at least 6 different stories each. Each story is a disheartening tale of a passionate programmer who is taken in by a company, drained of all their worth, and cast aside once their use has been fulfilled. Video games have become such a profitable industry, that investors have become highly involved in the production process. As a result, developers are seeing more and more of a push for high profit margins and low production costs, with less and less regard for quality work and humane conditions. Thus, many companies are leaning towards a hiring model of short term employment for the duration of a project, and quick firing once the product is released. This way, the company only has employees while a game is being made, and gets to keep all the profits. However, the worst part of this is the sheer audacity of these selfsame companies in the secrecy of their practices. Many of these stories talk of people relocating cross country, sometimes internationally, for a job they think is going to keep them for the next 5-10 years, only to find themselves out of a job a mere 2-3 years with an almost useless severance. Others work 70 hours a week on a project, only to come in one day and find themselves locked out of the network, and summoned to the office for a quick firing.

                  With conditions like these, it's no wonder developers often find themselves having to constantly work 12 hour days for months on end. As game studios are increasingly pushing for higher returns, they are simultaneously moving for shorter production times. However, rather than hire mroe developers to complete a project in a shorter timeframe, they push the employees they already have to work extended hours, usually for no extra pay. Not only does this practice drain the developers of any passion they have in their work, but it also destroys their relationships with friends and family. And yet, they have no choice but to endure it, because otherwise they face the dreaded layoffs. Studios have to show impressive numbers to their investors if they want to survive, which means their employees have to put in longs hours if they want to survive, creating a vicious unsustainable cycle that inevitably takes its toll. If things continue as they are, there's no doubt this incredibly profitable(and enjoyable) industry is going to bust. Developers are going to leave to find better paying, more stable, and more enjoyable jobs rather than put up with these terrible conditions. After all, they're the ones paying the price for our fun.
