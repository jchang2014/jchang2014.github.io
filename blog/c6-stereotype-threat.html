                  According to Steele and Aronson, stereotype threat is a concept that "refers to being at risk of conforming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group." They were essentially referring to what happens to a person's performance once stereotypes are brought into the equation. Specifically, in their experiments they tested the effect racial bias had on standardized test scores between Black students and White students. Their experiments showed that the Black students performed far more poorly when race was emphasized, but performed just as well when race wasn't emphasized. This showed the significant detrimental effect that can be self-inflicted by identifying with a stereotype.

                  I actually had an interesting experience with this during my time as an undergraduate at UCSD. During my first year, we had a campus-wide controversy that broke headlines across America. One of the fraternities on campus decided to hold a "Compton Cookout" in "honor" of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. This event sparked a movement across not just the African American student body, but also throughout the entire minority community. Looking at the student demographic of UCSD, you'll see that the percentage of Black students at UCSD remains below 3%. While it would be easy to blame racism and intolerance as the leading cause of this low representation(as many an ineffectual debate tried to,) a far more logical and accurate reasoning would be the stereotype threat.

                  Many minorities are characterized in the media as uncultured, unintelligent, and unproductive members of society. They are the gang members, drug dealers, and violent criminals that the "good guys" are always one step ahead of. Even the so-called "good examples" are often written off as either being "lucky" or having only made it thanks to the help of others. With representation like this, it's no wonder minorities often find themselves self-deprecating and unable to succeed. But it's not just minorities that suffer from this problem.All stereotypes force people into groups of negative traits and assumptions. Asians are terrible drivers, Jewish people are cheap, and White people are rednecks: you've heard them all before. Any and all of these stereotypes can affect each and every one of us in terrible ways. Now while we as a society are moving towards breaking down the walls of stereotypes that separate us and keep us down, we as individuals need to recognize that we hold the power over ourselves to succeed. Unless we recognize that our abilities are inherent, and can't be limited by the stereotypes other place upon us, we are doomed to be self-fulfilling prophecies who will only defeat ourselves.
