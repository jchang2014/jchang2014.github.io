        The benefits of version control are of great importance to developers. First and foremost, version control allows developers to keep track of changes made to their code from version to version. Every time a new change is committed, the developer can(and should) write a short statement about what was changed, and how. Secondly, version control allows developers to roll back to previous versions, assuming a bug in the code was introduced in a later version. Finally, version control is also incredibly useful when collaborating with others because the developers can not only keep track of the changes each other has made, but also set up an accountability system to check each others changes before they can be applied to the master code.

        Git helps you keep track of changes on many levels. First of all, you would ideally be working on a branch from your original “master” code, so that you don’t make any unnecessary changes to the master code until you are ready. Second, Git requires you to go through a series of checkpoints: untracked, tracked, staged, and committed. This way, it is constantly monitoring differences from inception of a file, until it is merged with the master file.

        Along with the usefulness of Git itself, there is an incredibly useful resource called GitHub. GitHub essentially acts as a cloud service/social networking website for developers. By keeping your master repositories on GitHub, you can clone them to your computer and work on them locally. Then, when you’re ready to make changes you can push those changes back up to GitHub. This especially comes in handy when developers are collaborating, because collaborators can work on different parts of the code at the same time, push them to GitHub, and have to approve or “pull” each other’s changes. Finally, because of the social networking aspect of GitHub, developers can choose to have their code on display for others to comment on and/or make contributions to.
